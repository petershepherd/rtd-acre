The ACRE Token Economy
=====================

This section defines the economic design of the ACRE token and its role within
the protocol. It focuses exclusively on token mechanics, access models, and
sustainability, without addressing broader strategic or philosophical
positioning.

The ACRE token is designed as a utility and coordination asset, not as an
investment vehicle, governance instrument, or representation of legal
ownership.

11.1 Token Design & Fair Launch
-------------------------------

The ACRE token has the following immutable properties:

- Token name: The Acre (ACRE)
- Total supply: 1,000,000,000 (fixed)
- Decimals: 6
- Distribution: 100% circulating at creation
- Team allocation: None
- Treasury allocation: None
- Mint authority: None
- Inflation: None

From inception, no entity, including the ACRE development team, has had
privileged access, control, or reserved allocation of the token supply.

This fair-launch design eliminates governance capture, supply overhang, and
misaligned incentives, and ensures that protocol operation is independent of
token price or inflation.

11.2 Legal Classification of the ACRE Token
-------------------------------------------

The ACRE token is explicitly not:

- An equity instrument,
- A security,
- A profit-sharing mechanism,
- A governance token,
- A representation of legal property ownership.

Instead, it functions solely as a technical access and coordination mechanism.

Key legal characteristics include:

- No expectation of profit from issuer activity,
- No governance rights over protocol rules or registries,
- No claim on assets, revenues, or legal titles,
- No dependency between protocol viability and token market performance.

This separation significantly reduces regulatory ambiguity and aligns ACRE with
infrastructure-level legal frameworks.

11.3 Usage Tiers & Access Model
-------------------------------

The ACRE token regulates technical access and operational capacity. Token
holdings grant no legal rights or ownership claims.

Defined usage tiers:

Tier 0 – Unverified User  
Holding: < 100,000 ACRE  
Property registration: Not permitted  

Tier 1 – Verified User  
Holding: ≥ 100,000 ACRE  
Maximum properties: 1  
Intended for individual property owners  

Tier 2 – Real Estate Broker  
Holding: ≥ 1,000,000 ACRE  
Maximum properties: 21  
Intended for professional brokers  

Tier 3 – Real Estate Agency / Institutional Operator  
Holding: ≥ 5,000,000 ACRE  
Maximum properties: Unlimited  

This tier model functions as a capacity control layer comparable to API rate
limits or enterprise software licensing.

11.4 Sustainability & Funding Model
-----------------------------------

The long-term viability of ACRE does not depend on token appreciation or
speculative incentives.
